# OpenAPI for MMS5 Layer 1

This repository generates an OpenAPI document defining MMS5 Layer 1's endpoints using a config script written in TypeScript.

The generated OpenAPI document can in turn be used to generate API documentation (hosted here using GitHub pages) and OpenAPI clients (although users should be aware that none of the request or response body content types are JSON, thus no schema information will be attached to the generated clients).


## Building the OpenAPI Document

See [scripts.yaml](./scripts.yaml) for instructions on how to build the OpenAPI document in JSON or YAML format.


## [Browse the API Documentation](https://openmbee.org/mms5-layer1-openapi/)

The generated OpenAPI document is deployed as an HTML webpage using RapiDoc and GitHub pages.
